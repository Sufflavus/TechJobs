DevFactory is especially suited for you, as we are a By Developers, for Developers focused company.</p> <br> <p>Are you a great Technical Product Manager looking for the next big thing?</p> <p>DevFactory is one of the most exciting companies you could imagine for Technical Product Managers. Hard problems, revolutionary technology, and a great team.</p> <br> <p>One of the best Technical Product Management jobs. Period.</p> <br> <p>Here are a just a few reasons why:</p> <ul> <li><p>By Developers for Developers: As a Technical Product Manager, you know software development. Youve very likely have had a significant portion of your career in software development. All those times you thought to yourself I would absolutely have created this tool way better... in this role you can. <br> Define products you would love to use.</p> </li> <li><p>Iteration, Improvement focused culture: We have a culture that not only enables your success, but strives to always think what better looks like. We view this iterative improvement as a necessity not only from an individual perspective, but as a team. You will be an integral part to improving not only products, but how we deliver products.</p> </li> <li><p>Career Focus: Candidates have a clear career path to increased compensation and responsibility. As your skills and competencies grow, your scope and area of impact will grow as well.</p> </li> <li><p>Customer Focus: At DevFactory, how our Customers will actually use our product (the use case), is the primary driver behind every specification. We believe that by centralizing the Use Case, we can focus on what makes our products great for our customers, and unique in the marketplace.</p> </li> <li><p>Learn and Use Disruptive Tech: Every day you hear about how some new company is applying disruptive technology to a stagnant industry. Wouldnt you like to be working for those innovative companies working on those new industry changing approaches? At Devfactory, this is your chance to be a part of that and both learn and apply these disruptive technologies (such as AI, Machine Learning, Big Data analysis, NLP, PaaS Cloud services) from Open Source, AWS, Google, and others.</p> </li> <li><p>Work/Life Balance: DevFactory is a fully remote company, with every role being a fully remote role. Simply put, DevFactory provides you with a unique work/life flexibility and the opportunity to work with a global team of top performers in their field.</p> </li> </ul> <br> <br> <br> <p>A bit about DevFactory</p> <p>The DevFactory culture is rooted in a deep appreciation of software and software development combined with an intense desire to use metrics and objective data to make software development better. We are inspired by the industrial manufacturing revolution that happened over 100 years ago. Jobs were loosely defined, not measured, not specialized, not automated, and the result was terrible quality and productivity. Today manufacturing is dominated by scientific measurement, automation, specialization, and well defined processes - making it very high quality and 100x more productive. We see the same opportunity in large scale software development.</p> <br> <p>We build systems that help make software and software dev teams better. We measure the quality of code, tests, builds, and architectures at a deep level; finding valuable insights not just surface level coding violations. We mine the history of source control systems to help dev teams find their buggiest parts of code, most productive developers, riskiest classes, etc. We build active systems that evaluate code on every commit and help our customers prevent their software quality from slowly eroding and accumulating expensive technical debt.</p> <br> <p>If making software better and development teams more productive is something you are passionate about, youll be inspired at DevFactory.</p> <br> <p>DevFactory is actively hiring candidates for this position through the CrossOver marketplace on Crossover.com. Crossover is one of the most legitimate companies offering high-paying jobs that are 100% remote, work from home. You never have to fight traffic to the office again and you have the freedom to choose when and where you put in your 40 hours to be most effective each week.</p> <br> <p>Responsibilities of the Role</p> <p>As a Technical Product Manager, your core responsibility is to take the big ideas from Product Management Leadership and figure out how to break it down into meaningful bite-size chunks for Engineering. Were relying on you to take that large complex release, figure out how it should be functionally broken down, and then defining that very clearly for the development team to go implement. Youll be using your deep technical background to identify the key decisions that need to be made (sometimes the hardest part!), finding the best answer to those questions and then defining both how the product will be implemented, and what you want to see to know that it was implemented correctly. </p> <br> At DevFactory were Agile. We have 1-2 week sprints that focus on a clear milestone of work in the greater release. As a Technical Product Manager, your primary responsibility is to take the large release level ideas and break it into clear Milestone specifications that the development team can actually build. As you will be the owner for the area, you will be ultimately responsible for reviewing what the engineering team has actually built and making the final call on if it meets exactly what you specified or needs additional work."],"pubDate":["Wed, 15 Feb 2017 12:56:18 Z"],"a10:updated":["2017-02-15T12:56:18Z"]},{"guid":[{"_":"128881","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"link":["http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/128881/senior-net-developer-xamarin-youi-insurance?a=HdO1jaQ8MlG"],"a10:author":[{"a10:name":["Youi Insurance"]}],"category":["c#","mvvm","asp.net","agile","xamarin"],"title":["Senior .NET Developer  Xamarin at Youi Insurance (Sunshine Coast, Australia)"],"description":["<ul><br /><li><strong>Agile environment + Modern tech stack</strong></li><br /><li><strong>Office located on the beautiful Sunshine Coast</strong></li><br /><li><strong>Enormous potential to stamp your mark and do some of your best work in the .NET space&nbsp;</strong></li><br /></ul><br /><p>Youi has established high performing IT software development teams at its headquarters on the beautiful Sunshine Coast, just north of Brisbane.

The Iqbal group develops such methods. Their work ranges from development of novel algorithms and data structures, to concrete implementations translating research ideas into clinical practise. For example their Mykrobe predictor software has been integrated into Public Health England&rsquo;s tuberculosis pipeline. Dr Iqbal spent 8 years in the software industry after his PhD, working in development and software management in embedded operating systems for mobile device and network drivers, before returning to academia. The rest of the group have degrees in maths, physics and biology. <br> <br> EMBL-EBI, the UK site of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), has been a global leader in computational biology research since its inception in 1994. Located on the Wellcome Genome Campus, we are at the centre of one of the highest concentrations of technical and scientific expertise in the world. Our research spans fundamental methods in sequence analysis, multi-dimensional statistical analysis and data-driven biological discovery, from plant biology to mammalian development and disease. We are highly collaborative and interdisciplinary, regularly publishing high-impact works on sequence and structural alignment, genome analysis, basic biological breakthroughs, algorithms and methods of widespread importance.<br> <br> As a Scientific Programmer, you would lead the development and maintenance of key scientific software developed by the Iqbal group.

Others do it poorly because the requirements were vague. We could fix that if we had better specs</p> </li> <li><p>You have an interest in the customer who uses the product you are building. Youd like to be involved in determining *what* is built, not just *how*</p> </li> <li><p>You want to grow your career and responsibility by learning the skills needed to lead/run entire development teams</p> </li> </ul> <br> <p>Responsibilities of the Role</p> <p>As a Technical Product Manager, your core responsibility is to define the technical interface/contract between the Product Management organization (that defines product) and the Engineering organization (that delivers product). This requires the definition of clear functional requirements, important technical decisions, and acceptance criteria into a specification document that can be consumed by an engineering delivery team. </p> <br> <p>At DevFactory we create specs in chunks that can be built in roughly 1 week by an agile dev team (epics) and the dev teams themselves do their own work breakdowns into smaller assignments (tickets). We call these specs Level 3 specs, or L3s and the engineering deliverable that meets these requirements a milestone. Several milestones will typically be required to accomplish some end-to-end business or technical scenario. The description of that overall scenario and the high-level L3 plan is contained in a document called a Level 2 spec, or L2.</p> <br> <p>The primary responsibility of this role is to create L3 specs by translating the business and technical requirements described in the L2 spec into a series of L3 specs that the development team can build. You will also review engineering deliverables that correspond to L3 specs and review them to determine whether or not they meet the documented requirements.</p> <p>A bit about DevFactory</p> <p>The DevFactory culture is rooted in a deep appreciation of software and software development combined with an intense desire to use metrics and objective data to make software development better. We are inspired by the industrial manufacturing revolution that happened over 100 years ago. Jobs were loosely defined, not measured, not specialized, not automated, and the result was terrible quality and productivity. Today manufacturing is dominated by scientific measurement, automation, specialization, and well defined processes - making it very high quality and 100x more productive. We see the same opportunity in large scale software development.</p> <br> <p>We build systems that help make software and software dev teams better. We measure the quality of code, tests, builds, and architectures at a deep level; finding valuable insights not just surface level coding violations. We mine the history of source control systems to help dev teams find their buggiest parts of code, most productive developers, riskiest classes, etc. We build active systems that evaluate code on every commit and help our customers prevent their software quality from slowly eroding and accumulating expensive technical debt.</p> <br> <p>If making software better and development teams more productive is something you are passionate about, youll be inspired at DevFactory.</p> <br>"],"pubDate":["Thu, 16 Feb 2017 17:22:39 Z"],"a10:updated":["2017-02-16T17:22:39Z"]},{"guid":[{"_":"127805","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"link":["http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/127805/front-end-developer-bidmath?a=GRqSYtE17kQ"],"a10:author":[{"a10:name":["Bidmath"]}],"category":["javascript","ruby-on-rails","python","nosql"],"title":["Front End Developer at Bidmath (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"],"description":["Bidmath is currently looking for an experienced Web / Front End Engineer to work within our Development team in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.<p><br />We are a leading digital advertising technology company.

We recognise that this is a really big responsibility and we are proud and excited to be able to make such a big impact on people's daily lives.</p><br /><p>We love our devs! They are an awesome bunch that feel the same way about our product as we do, so we try our best to give them all the support and tools they need to deliver this world changing product. We don't like getting in the way, so in general we try to enable others to do things themselves, by automating as much as possible and giving them the buttons to push. This isn't easy because the environment needs to be PCI compliant, but we see that as a cool challenge, and so far we are doing great!</p><br /><p>We also love AWS. AWS services like EC2 and RDS allow us to do so much with so little, so we use it as much as possible and try avoid deploying anything to our in-house VMware cluster. We also like Docker - we don't love it yet, but who knows :)</p><br /><p>We have a lot of fun in Ops, mostly laughing at with each other about stupid things, but when the business needs us, we are there for them. We believe that it is our personal responsibility to ensure that our commuter friends in Boston or Athens or New York are able to ride the train/bus with our app, so we do everything that it takes to ensure that happens.</p><br /><p><strong>The person we are looking for...</strong></p><br /><p>You will have some years of commercial experience in computing, either in ops or in development. You will be using Linux as your server OS of choice, but to be fair you&rsquo;ll use whatever works. You can code.</p><br /><p>If you are currently in ops, from day one you have scripted your admin tasks, so you are comfortable talking about your code with a developer. You probably started out on bash, but nowadays you use something more powerful like Python or Ruby because bash just doesn&rsquo;t cut it anymore.</p><br /><p>You are aware of the power of AWS and newer things like containerisation - either from your own commercial experience or because you play with them at home when you get bored. You don't rack servers, but you&rsquo;ll help the Service Desk guy carry those boxes because he&rsquo;s an awesome guy and, well, why wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p><br /><p>If you are currently a developer, infrastructure excites you and DevOps seems like an interesting new playground. You enjoy learning different programming languages and are not afraid of trying something new.</p><br /><p>Although you enjoy working by yourself (normally at home, just getting things done) you are happier when working with your teammates, solving complex business-critical problems. Your teammates often become your friends, because they have similar interests to you, and you respect their contribution to the group. You get excited when someone can teach you something new. You get excited when someone near you succeeds, especially if you had a little something to do with it.</p><br /><p><strong>The Infrastructure</strong></p><br /><p> &nbsp;Linux<br> &nbsp;Amazon EC2, RDS, ELB, Autoscaling, CloudFormation<br> &nbsp;Puppet, Artifactory<br> &nbsp;Jenkins, Bamboo<br> &nbsp;Git<br> &nbsp;MySQL<br> &nbsp;Logentries</p>"],"pubDate":["Tue, 31 Jan 2017 14:06:02 Z"],"a10:updated":["2017-01-31T14:06:02Z"],"location":[{"_":"Greater London, UK","$":{"xmlns":"http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/"}}]},{"guid":[{"_":"133908","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"link":["http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/133908/global-brand-cutting-edge-product-top-evestment?a=IUkCsoNPPIk"],"a10:author":[{"a10:name":["eVestment"]}],"category":[".net","java","javascript","c#","extjs"],"title":["Global Brand, Cutting Edge Product  Top Developers Wanted! at eVestment (Atlanta, GA)"],"description":["<p><strong>OK, so what will you be doing?</strong><br>&bull; Contribute to development team responsible for implementation of web, JavaScript, and service applications using the .Net Framework, rich JavaScript Application Frameworks, Redis, Elasticsearch, and SQL Server technologies.<br>&bull; Creation of amazing user-experiences with the very latest front-end technologies.<br>&bull; Collaborate with business stakeholders and technology team members to add enhancements and new products in a fast growing software-as-a-service (SaaS) business.<br>&bull; Design and create simple, maintainable code and comprehensive automated tests.<br>&bull; Responsible for timely development and delivery of high-quality software in an Agile Scrum based environment.</p>"],"pubDate":["Sun, 26 Feb 2017 14:08:07 Z"],"a10:updated":["2017-02-26T14:08:07Z"],"location":[{"_":"Atlanta, GA","$":{"xmlns":"http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/"}}]},{"guid":[{"_":"131360","$":{"isPermaLink":"false"}}],"link":["http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/131360/software-engineer-datadog?a=I3lQnbfAUVy"],"a10:author":[{"a10:name":["Datadog"]}],"category":["go","python","reactjs","apache-kafka","apache-spark"],"title":["Software Engineer at Datadog (New York, NY) (allows remote)"],"description":["<p><span>Have you built sizeable applications for thousands of users?
